**first off be careful dont be working in the rain or with wet hands..**

be sure to use 12-21v panels. 

i recommend lithium batterys but the software will work with s9 capacitor only version if you purchase a 3500f capacitor bank

follow the pdf if youre confused feel free to ask. 

you can essentially use this to run an s9 directly off the dc from solar with random junk you've got laying around

the products i sell are advanced on this, since we all helped get it to where it is i'll release old versions open source and we'll continue to improve and create more cool stuff.

thanks for supporting the cause both buying the stuff i produce and by donating.. every single dollar helps advance and open source products.
